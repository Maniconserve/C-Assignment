 Assignments: 
 1. Take two strings as input and check whether the second string is a sub-string of the first or not. If yes, print the number of times occurred in S1 and print the index positions where the string 
 appeared 
 i/p : S1 = “abcdabcabd” S2 = “ab” 
 o/p: No.of times occurred = 3 Index positions = 0 4 7
 
 2. Find the four adjacent digits in any given number that have the greatest product. What is the value of this product? 
 i/p: 1234568987458744574664554 (input can be any) 
 o/p: 8*9*8*7=4032 
 3. Input: Consider n, and m as two float inputs Implementation: Convert float inputs to binary and perform addition and convert the result back to float.
Output: Print the float result
